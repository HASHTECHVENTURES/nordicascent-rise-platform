# Homepage Landing Page Redesign

## What's Changing
The current homepage works but feels a bit flat and generic. Based on the client's request for a "Marketing / Brand Landing Page" feel, here's the plan to elevate it into a premium, Nordic-inspired landing page.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Hero Section - More Impact
- Larger, full-width hero with a warm sand/cream background (using the brand's Neutral Sand color)
- Bolder headline with the gradient text on "Talent & Opportunity" more prominent
- Add a subtle tagline/label above the headline (e.g., "Nordic Talent Mobility")
- Better image presentation with a slight overlay or shadow treatment
- Animate elements on load (fade-in-up)

### 2. Stats Bar - More Premium
- Add subtle animation/hover effects to the numbers
- Use a cleaner divider style between stats instead of a full bordered section

### 3. "Why Nordic Ascent" Section - Visual Upgrade
- Remove card borders, use subtle shadows and hover lift effects instead
- Add gradient icon backgrounds for a more polished look
- Slightly larger icons and better spacing

### 4. "Built for Both Sides" Section - Cleaner Design
- Use a subtle gradient background instead of flat card background
- Add hover effects on the cards
- Make the CTAs more prominent with filled buttons instead of outline

### 5. "Our Process" Section - Add Visual Interest
- Add a simple 7-dot/step visual indicator (not the full pipeline, just a hint)
- Brief one-liner per stage to tease without being technical
- Keep the "Learn About Our Pipeline" CTA

### 6. Final CTA Section - Stronger Close
- Full-width with a subtle background pattern or gradient
- Two CTAs: one for companies, one for candidates
- Add a short testimonial or trust statement

### 7. Overall Polish
- Add scroll-triggered fade-in animations to sections
- Ensure consistent spacing and visual rhythm
- Use the brand's warm sand tones for alternating section backgrounds
- Improve typography hierarchy (lighter body text, bolder headings)

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Complete content and styling overhaul
